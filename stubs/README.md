# aioquiqy-stubs

Type stubs for the aioquiqy library.

## Installation

```bash
pip install aioquiqy-stubs
```

## Usage

These stubs provide type information for the aioquiqy library. They are automatically used by type checkers like mypy, pyright, and pyre when installed alongside the main aioquiqy package.

## Development

This package contains type stubs (.pyi files) that mirror the structure of the main aioquiqy library, providing complete type annotations for all public APIs.

## License

Same as the main aioquiqy library.
